# WATCH_dojo(This is the coding dojo training for FTSHO1/FTSH02 )
Your task is to implement a WATCH, which has two functions, one is timer and one is displaying the current time. And there are three buttons, when you press the switch button, it changes the state between the timer and watch (let’s set the default state is timer state).   When it is in timer state,the timer’s default value is 0 , if you press the up button, it will start to counting and the value will be updated every second, then press up button again, it will stop and the third time you press the up button, the timer will go on counting based last counting result;If you press the down button, the timer will be reset.When it is in watch state, it just display the current time and the up and down button do not work. We will reuse the FSM and LCD code that we had written before and the WATCH interface I have given out, please the GuiObserver files.
